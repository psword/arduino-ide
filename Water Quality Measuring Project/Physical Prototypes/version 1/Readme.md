A directory containing photos of the original 3D printed concept. This was among my first attempts at using Autodesk Fusion 360. I tried to imagine what it could look like. I experimented with several interlocking mechanisms with modularity in mind, with none of them suitable for actual use.

This was the model our team submitted as a final product for assessment. There were many other tasks besides simply designing a model. After this initial project leg was complete, our team dissolved due to our separate degree program tracks, and I continued along the same vein.

This model was not intended to be used, but used only as an example.
