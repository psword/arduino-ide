# Version 2
## Update to project

Since version 1 was a lab-based concept, proceeding to version 2 was about condensing the electronics and creating efficiency. Also, experimenting with successful and failed solutions.

This folder contains the code to convert the design to an ESP32-based architecture. I am not a programmer by trade, nor have I been working in the "coding industry" - I am a network engineer/sysadmin by training, currently a student (back to school) in a unique IoT program. Adapting that knowledge has been quite entertaining.
