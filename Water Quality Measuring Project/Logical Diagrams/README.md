# Logical Diagrams
This folder contains concept diagrams based on a modular, multi-sensor design. Currently, these are designs suitable for lab-based operation. We are progressing in transitioning the concept to a design for field testing.

  These snapshots show the design's intended purpose and flow of information. I overdid the project on purpose, but I believe the ideas are sound and will take some refinement.

  One day last year, we traveled to HAMK's Valkeakoski Campus and brainstormed with the Electrical and Automation Engineering students, using break-out teams. This page shows our team's results for that day.
