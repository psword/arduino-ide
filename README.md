 Various code snips for MCUs. This includes short sketches for:

 - Arduino R3 UNO

 It also contains a lab project for a prototype (version 1) that allows:

 - I2C communication between MCUs

 - Code to connect to thinger.io and deliver basic information

This was originally part of a university project and should be considered version 1.
